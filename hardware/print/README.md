# Printing

I printed the parts in the following quantities & materials at [JLC3DP](https://jlc3dp.com/):

| STL-file | quantity | method | material | notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `top-left` | 1 | SLA | 8001 Resin (transparent)
| `top-right` | 1 | SLA | 8001 Resin (transparent)
| `bottom-left` | 1 | SLA | 8001 Resin (transparent)
| `bottom-right` | 1 | SLA | 8001 Resin (transparent)
| `keycaps-1` | 1 | SLA | 8001 Resin (transparent) | connected parts
| `keycaps-2` | 3 | SLA | 8001 Resin (transparent) | connected parts
| `misc` | 1 | MJF | PA12-HP Nylon | connected parts

The above is the requirement for exactly one keyboard.
To be safer I recommend printing one extra set for all the connected parts.
