# Keyboard setup

I use a 36 key [Chocofi](https://github.com/pashutk/chocofi) keyboard with a [Sprintek SK8707-01 trackpoint](https://www.sprintek.com/en/products/pointing_stick/SK8707-01.aspx), made wireless with [nice!nano's](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano).

This repo is where I keep my [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) as well as my [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) setup, and also the files to print the keyboard case & key caps.
Since I like having all my keybindings available on my laptop's built-in keyboard as well, most of the interesting stuff is implemented with Karabiner rather than ZMK.
