# My ZMK Keyboard setup

I use a five-column [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) keyboard I made
wireless with [nice!nano's](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano). This is my
config of the [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) firmware.

There is not much here because I use Karabiner Elements rather than my
keyboard's firmware for all the fancy stuff! Check out my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/jannis-baum/dotfiles) for my [visualized keyboard
layers](https://github.com/jannis-baum/dotfiles/blob/main/docs.nosync/keyboard-layers.md)
and my [karabiner.edn definition
file](https://github.com/jannis-baum/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/karabiner.edn)
